<h3>Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB</h3>
</div>

API created for one of my [Web Dev Bootcamp's projects](https://github.com/vivitt/movie-app/tree/main).

It is a Node.js project connected with a MongoDB cluster.

It provides endoints for register and authenticate users, and to access a list of movies and add/remove favorite movies in a User model.
